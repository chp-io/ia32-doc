#     in this document.
#
#

#
# Base type
# ---------
#
#   - These fields are common for each YAML object type.
#

- ShortName: WC                           # General short name
  LongName: WC_SUPPORTED                  # General long name
  OriginalShortName: Wc                   # Suggested short name (by document/manual)
  OriginalLongName: (Wc)_Supported        # Suggested long name (by document/manual)
                                          #   Note that text in parentheses is used as hint
                                          #   to keep case-sensitivity
  AlternativeShortName: WRITE_COMBINED    # Author's subjective best (descriptive) short name
  AlternativeLongName: WRITE_COMBINED     # Author's subjective best (descriptive) long name

  NameWithPostfix: REGISTER               # Appended to parent's name (used in groups)

  ShortDescription: Description doesn't end with dot
  LongDescription: |
    Description must end with dot.
  Description: Description is used as both long/short. Can be multiline. Must end with dot.

  ChildrenNameWithPrefix: GUEST           # Prepend to children's name (used in groups)
  ChildrenNameWithPostfix: REGISTER       # Appended to children's name (used in groups)
                                          # Use '$' for "Name".

  Note: |                                 # Additional notes.
    Add one to the return value to get the result.

  #
  # Note:
  #   Name, OriginalName, AlternativeName and Description expand to
  #   both Short* and Long* versions.
  #
  # Note2:
  #   If *Name (except OriginalNames) contains ABC(XXX)DEF pattern -
  #   text in parentheses, it can be used as hint; eg. in numbering.
  #   Example: IA32_PMC(n)
